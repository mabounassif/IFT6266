## Linear Algebra
*	Matrix multiplication is not commutative unlike scalar multiplication:

	$$$ \boldsymbol{AB} \neq \boldsymbol{BA} $$$

*	The dot product between 2 vectors is cumulative:

	$$$ \boldsymbol{x}^{T}\boldsymbol{y} = \boldsymbol{y}^{T}\boldsymbol{x} $$$
	
*	The transpose of a matrix product has a simple form:

	$$$ (\boldsymbol{AB})^{T} = \boldsymbol{B}^{T} \boldsymbol{A}^{T} $$$
