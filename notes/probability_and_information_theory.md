*	** Difference between frequentists and bayesian: ** frequentists are concerned with the rate of occurence of a certain event whereas Bayesians are concerned about the qualitative levels of certainty.

*	The ** covariance ** gives some sense of how much two values are linearly related to each other, as well as the scale of these variables:
	$$  Cov(\mathit{f(x)},\mathit{g(y)}) = \mathbb{E[(\mathit{f(x) - \mathbb{E[\mathit{f(x)}]}})(\mathit{g(y)}-\mathbb{E[\mathit{g(y)}]})]}  $$
	
	1. **High absolute values of covariance** mean that the **values change very much** and **both far from their respective means at the same time**
	2.	If the ** sign of the covariance is positive**, then **both variables** tend to take on relatively **high values simultaneously**
	3.	If the ** sign of the covariance is negative**, then **one variable** tends to take on a relatively **high value** at times that **the other** takes on a relatively **low value** and **vice versa**
	
	**N.B: ** 
	
	a.	2 independent variables $$$ \to $$$ zero covariance
	b.	2 variables that have nonzero covariance $$$ \to $$$ dependent
	c.	Independence is a stronger requirement than zero covariance because it also exclude nonlinear relationships. But two variables can be dependent and have zero covariance.
